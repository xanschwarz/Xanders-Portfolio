# Xanders-Portfolio

This repository is for a portfolio app showcasing information about myself and the work I've done. It features a nav bar with internal page links, an About Me section describing myself, a My Work section showcasing projects I've worked on, and a footer with my contact information. Flex boxes and media queries are used throughout for responsive design. Future revisions will add more projects and changes to styling.

Getting the layout to present how I wanted was particularly tricky, I had to dig deep into how flex boxes work. At the time of this commit I also intend to go through the CSS file and see if there is any cleaning up I can do. A reset CSS will help with getting the page styles exactly how I want them.
