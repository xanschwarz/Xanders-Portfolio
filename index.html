          <p>
            I am an aspiring software developer, currently attending UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp. Before this I completed a B.S. degree in Structural Engineering at UCSD, then worked for 3 years as an aerospace engineer for Collins Aerospace through an engineering services company.

            I was born and raised in San Diego, but I have family across the states and more distant relatives in Europe. During my free time I enjoy traveling, photography, reading, and gaming. I can frequently be found lifting in the gym but also love the outdoors. When I have the time I love to homebrew beer as well as the occasional mead and hard cider, I've even won awards at the local fair and placed in the first round of the largest national competition.
